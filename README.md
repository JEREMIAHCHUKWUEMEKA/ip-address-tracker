# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker Solution

This is my solution to the [IP Address Tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). The challenge involves building a web app that allows users to input an IP address or domain name and returns geolocation data, along with a map indicating the location.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on screen size (mobile/desktop)
- Automatically see their own IP address geolocation on first load
- Enter an IP address or domain and get:
  - IP
  - Location
  - Timezone
  - ISP
  - Marker on the map

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with Vite
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) with [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- [IPify Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/)
- Netlify for deployment

### What I learned

This project helped me:

- Understand how to use and secure environment variables in a React + Vite app
- Work with external APIs like IPify to fetch IP geolocation data
- Render dynamic Leaflet maps with React and show markers based on API response
- Deploy React apps with environment variables using Netlify

```js
const fetchIPInfo = async (ip = '') => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://geo.ipify.org/api/v2/country,city', {
    params: {
      apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_IPIFY_API_KEY,
      ipAddress: ip,
    },
  });
  setIpData(response.data);
};
```

### Continued development

Iâ€™d like to explore:

- Adding error handling and loading states
- Allowing domain name input (currently only IP tested)
- Improving accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Adding history tracking of previous searches
